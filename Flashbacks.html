												<p>After shipwrecking on the island, Oliver buried his father on a hillside. He meet a man named<strong>Yao Fei,</strong> he taught Oliver everything he knows now, well most of it. He taught Oliver how to do archery which molded him into <strong>The Arrow.</strong> He also meet a girl named <strong>Shado,</strong> she was Yao Fei's daughter and Oliver really liked her. When Yao Fei was captured and "turned" to there side he was used to get his dauther. He was told to kill Oliver so he sneaked a map to a crash plane site and pushed him off a cliff into a lake. When Oliver when to the crash site he meet Slate, Slate was going to kill Oliver but then found some raw potential for combat and survival. So Slate started training him in close combat, thats where he learned that. When Slate and Oliver worked together they freed Shado. Together they were a good power team, Shado taught him Marksmanship.    </p>
