When Oliver and Tommy went into there twenty's they came across some scandals which gave Tommy a bad reputation- a reputation of a playboy. Later on, he went on a cruise ship with Sara Lance Laurel's younger sister (he was going to cheat on Laurel). In the middle of the cruise ship trip, the ship was ambushed and only Robert and Oliver Queen survived. However, on the getaway boat, Robert shot himself so Oliver could survive. Oliver then arrived on an abandoned island called <strong>Lian Yu.</strong> After five years in Lian Yu, he got out on a fisherman's boat. When he arrived back at <strong>Starling City,</strong> he was a changed man and became the <strong>Arrow</strong>. In every episode there are flash backs which show what Oliver went through on the island.  </p>
